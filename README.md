# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The data of credit risk is unbalanaced classification problem, with using different models, I will
train and evaluate different models. The results will be compared and contrasted to show which model 
is the best fit for evaluating credit risk.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. 
Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Below is a list of all the results of each the 6 different models used.

Oversampling
	Accuracy score: 0.72
	Precision: 0.99
	Recall: 0.72
SMOTE Oversampling
	Accuracy score: 0.73
	Precision: 0.99
	Recall: 0.73
Undersampling
	Accuracy score: 0.70
	Precision: 0.99
	Recall: 0.66
SMOTEENN 
	Accuracy score: 0.73
	Precision: 0.99
	Recall: 0.73
Balanced Random Forest
	Accuracy score: 0.73
	Precision: 0.99
	Recall: 0.84
Easy Ensemble Adaboost
	Accuracy score: 0.93
	Precision: 0.99
	Recall: 0.94

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

In the resampling notebook, the results remain about the same with little difference. Undersampling has the lowest accuracy score of .70. 
With the balanced random forest, there is improvement in the recall score meaning more samples have the correct predicitions. 
Using Easy Ensemble has the best results out of all six models with a accuracy score of 0.93 and a recall of 0.94. The easy ensemble classificer 
as the highest rate to correctly predicit credit risk levels.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

In the resampling notebook, the results remain about the same with little difference. Under sampling has the lowest accuracy score of .70. 
With the balanced random forest, there is improvement in the recall score meaning more samples have the correct predictions. 
Using Easy Ensemble has the best results out of all six models with an accuracy score of 0.93 and a recall of 0.94. The easy ensemble classifier as the highest rate to correctly predict credit risk levels.
